This mini project explores the development of a password security system using digital gates and basic electronic components. The system leverages a combination of 4001 quad NOR gates and 4070 quad XOR gates to process a binary password inputted via eight- position dip switches. Visual feedback through LEDs and a reset mechanism using a pushbutton switch enhance user interaction. The project aims to provide a hands-on understanding of digital logic principles while demonstrating a rudimentary yet effective approach to password security. The report discusses the system's design, challenges encountered during implementation, and potential avenues for improvement. Overall, this project contributes to the practical application of digital gates in a security context using easily accessible components.
